 ? size palette settings
 ? place text cursor where you clicked when reopening texts

 # license
  > I'd like to include a public domain dedication, but I want to make it clear that only the application is in the public domain; anything you create with it doesn't have to be, and you shouldn't have to dig into it and remove the dedication
  > maybe it would suffice to have a separate license file in the repo and a link to it in the main file?
 - undo/redo list
  ? ^Z ^Y keyboard shortcuts
 ? clipboard interaction with SVG objects (not just text in textToolInput)
  > complicated by browser security considerations
  ? ^X ^C ^V keyboard shortcuts
 - collaboration via WebRTC/STUN/TURN/ICE/acronym-of-the-week
  ? add corresponding section to settings
  ? with A/V/text chat inset
 - move tool drag from either end of an arrow = move just that end (switch back to arrow tool? or just use arrow tool for this instead of move?)
  ? need marker for tail of arrow
 ? allow arrows to other arrows
  > harder than other objects because movement becomes recursive
