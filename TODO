Key:
= task grouping
- ongoing or not started
? unsure whether I will start/continue to work on it
# completed
> more information (not a subtask)

= bugfixes
 # make undo/redo apply to size/color changes
 - copy tool breaks when trying to copy arrow-connected objects
 - disabling fisheye panning in Firefox temporarily breaks the pan tool until another tool is activated
 - panning with the scroll wheel/gesture doesn't pan the selection
 - "move" icon alignment on Firefox
 - don't XML-escape imported text files (readAsText seems to do this in Chrome but not Firefox?)
 ? delete sometimes doesn't work?
 ? trashcan vs. eraser

= enhancements of existing features
 ? make new open a new tab/window with a blank document (using data URI) instead of clearing the current document
 # import text files as well as images (using current text tool settings)
 ? import on drop event
 ? resize imported images (add a handle when selected?)
 ? calibration boxes for scroll wheel/gesture for pan/zoom
 - preview fisheye border settings
 ? size palette settings
 ? place text cursor where you clicked when reopening texts
 - zoom level selector
 - make the zoom level indicator take less horizontal space
 - multitouch pinch to zoom (multitouch pan should already work via scroll events)
  > waiting to get access to a device with a multitouch screen
 ? should changing the selection count as an action for undo/redo?

= new features
 # license
  > I'd like to include a public domain dedication, but I want to make it clear that only the application is in the public domain; anything you create with it doesn't have to be, and you shouldn't have to dig into it and remove the dedication
  > maybe it would suffice to have a separate license file in the repo and a link to it in the main file?
 # undo/redo list
  # ^Z ^Y keyboard shortcuts
  # buttons next to delete
 ? clipboard interaction with SVG objects (not just text in textToolInput)
  > complicated by browser security considerations
  ? ^X ^C ^V keyboard shortcuts
 - collaboration via WebRTC/STUN/TURN/ICE/acronym-of-the-week
  ? add corresponding section to settings
  ? with A/V/text chat inset
 - move tool drag from either end of an arrow = move just that end (switch back to arrow tool? or just use arrow tool for this instead of move?)
  ? need marker for tail of arrow
 ? allow arrows to other arrows
  > harder than other objects because movement becomes recursive
