 # copy button
 - connection tool
 - menu items
  # new: just clear everything in doc and selection
  # open: load file and copy everything under doc-and-selection
   - import: load file and put its contents in the selection
  # save: make data URI from document.outerHTML, put it in a link with a content-disposition that makes the browser save it instead of loading it again
   - export: make a data URI for just the doc without the UI 
   ? also export to PNG using the canvas trick I used for cursors

  # zoom level indicator
  - zoom level selector
  - optional multitouch gestures
   - pinch zoom
   # two-finger pan/move

- bugfixes
 # clicking on an object in select mode also selects objects in its bounding box?!
 # anchor selection when switching away from selection/copy tools
 # cursor hotspots
 # don't add empty <text>s
 - apply zoom to textToolInput
 - compensate for scrollwheel zoom chunkiness/directionality differences among different browsers/scrolling devices
 - make the zoom level indicator take less horizontal space
 - let selectRect expand in any direction, not just down+right
 - don't fill selection cursor (or come up with a different cursor)
 ? trashcan vs. eraser
 # lots of refactoring
